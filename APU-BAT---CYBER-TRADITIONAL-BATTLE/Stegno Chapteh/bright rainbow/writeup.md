In this challenge, you're provided with two files: a zip file and an image. Given that the challenge is titled *'Bright Rainbow,'* it suggests the focus is on the image’s color. You can use any online tool or the `StegSolve` tool from GitHub to manipulate the image colors and reveal hidden information.

He mentioned that the message is actually the password for my archive, not the flag. The password itself is `{2_th0us4nd_y34rs_4g0}`, which can be a bit confusing since it’s enclosed in curly braces, making it look like a flag format.

**Password:** `{2_th0us4nd_y34rs_4g0}`

Once you unzip the file using the password:

The actual flag is: `BAT{2_th0us4nd_y34r$_4g0}`.
