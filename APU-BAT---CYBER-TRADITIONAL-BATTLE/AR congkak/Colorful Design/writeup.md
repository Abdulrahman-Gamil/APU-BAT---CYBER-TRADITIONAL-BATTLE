### During an art lecture, Wala sent an image to her friend. The lecturer, spotting the distraction, intercepted the network traffic and captured the image. Sensing that something might be hidden within, the lecturer now needs your help. Your task is to decrypt the secret message concealed in the image between Wala and her friend. Can you uncover what’s hidden behind this colorful image?

Here is the provided image, and the colors appear ‎suspicious, particularly after examining it with various tools ‎like ExifTool, Hex Editor, Strings, zsteg, and Aperisolve. Given ‎this, let's focus on the color aspect. We know that colors ‎can also be represented in hexadecimal format. Therefore, ‎we'll use an online tool to extract the hex values of each ‎color for every letter in the image.‎

We utilized the online tool at ``https://colorcodefinder.com`` to ‎analyze the color codes represented by 3-byte hexadecimal ‎values, such as 2f2999. Upon examination, we observed a ‎pattern where the first three hex digits of each color were ‎unique, while the last three digits remained consistent as ‎‎999 for all the letters. This led us to extract and analyze the ‎hex values, which initially resembled a hash after ‎decryption. To investigate further, we removed the recurring ‎‎999 values and attempted to decrypt the remaining hex ‎digits.
